# Smart-Health-Prediction

In the Django project, the Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regression, Vector Regression and Linear Regression algorithms were used to estimate a data set. Based on the characteristics in the dataset, these two machine learning methods were applied to predict the target variable. Linear Regression examined the linear relationships between data using a linear regression model, whereas Decision Tree Regressor produced predictions using the decision tree structure in the dataset. 

The goal output predicted by these models was attained based on the data input by the user. The project's goal was to create a viable data analytics and forecasting application by using the Django framework to provide target result predictions based on user-provided data. You can see the test results from the figures below. Working with multidimensional datasets is where Vector Regression shines. learns a function for a set of numerical vectors that represent the attributes of the data. The method used to convert the input data to an output value is determined by this function. For complex data interactions, Vector Regression can employ multiple linear regression models in addition to more sophisticated models like polynomial and radial-based functions.

An assembly called Random Forest Regression is produced by mixing many decision trees. Each decision tree is created using the data from a particular subset after being trained with that subset. These trees are then combined, averaged, or weighted to get an estimate. Random Forest Regression may choose the data's characteristics automatically and find numerous combinations. Therefore, it performs particularly well on data with nonlinear relationships.
